    "**Judoor** is the unified user portal for accessing Jülich Supercomputing Centre (JSC) resources. It manages:\n",
    "- User authentication\n",
    "- Project memberships\n",
    "- Compute time allocations\n",
    "- Resource access permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why HPC for Machine Learning?\n",
    "- **Large Datasets:** Sentinel-2 imagery can be terabytes in size\n",
    "- **GPU Acceleration:** Deep learning models require GPU compute\n",
    "- **Parallel Processing:** Data preprocessing can be parallelized across many CPU cores\n",
    "- **Storage:** Centralized storage for shared datasets and models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Course Resources\n",
    "- **Project ID:** `training2600`\n",
    "- **Available Partitions:**\n",
    "  - `JURECA-DC_CPU`: 128 cores/node, 512 GB RAM\n",
